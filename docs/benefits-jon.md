With a career as storied as his, Jon’s legacy projects at GI go beyond mere retrospectives. They are about forging paths.

As a Cultural Ambassador for Global Change, Jon stitches his narrative of hope and accountability into the fabric of international relations, promoting dialogue that’s as engaging as it is essential.
